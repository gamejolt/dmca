Dear Copyright Agent:

 

Our office represents Scott Cawthon, the creator, author and intellectual property owner of the “Five Nights at Freddy’s” video games and multimedia franchise (collectively, “Five Nights”).  Mr. Cawthon is the rightful legal owner of these properties and the titles, characters, themes, plots, stories and settings thereof (the “Intellectual Property”). 

 

Mr. Cawthon has registered hundreds of copyrights with the United States Copyright Office relating to Five Nights.  Five Nights itself is protected by numerous U.S. Copyright Registrations, including, PA0001952793, PA0001927262, PA0001927442, PA0001952786, PA0001956899 and PAu003786730.  Mr. Cawthon has also copyrighted characters in his game including, but by no means limited to, Freddy Fazbear (U.S. Reg. VA0001968311). 

 

Furthermore and without limitation, Mr. Cawthon has trademarked “Five Nights at Freddy’s” (U.S. Reg. No. 4755325 and 4855473).

 

We are notifying you that the Intellectual Property as outlined above is being infringed upon at the following links on the GameJolt website:

The infringing video games (“Infringing Games”) were uploaded to the GameJolt website and made available to the public without the authorization of Mr. Cawthon or any of his agents. The Infringing Games are unauthorized derivative works that heavily incorporate various protected images, art, graphics, titles, characters, themes, plots, stories and/or settings, as well as the Five Nights “look and feel”.

 

Such blatant disregard for Mr. Cawthon’s intellectual property rights amounts to copyright and trademark infringement. The Infringing Games clearly intend to trade off the goodwill and reputation of the Intellectual Property, in violation of applicable trademark laws. Such improper violations of Mr. Cawthon’s intellectual property rights constitute unfair competition, passing off, dilution and/or tarnishment.

 

This letter is official notification under the Digital Millennium Copyright Act that Mr. Cawthon seeks the immediate removal of the aforementioned Infringing Games from the GameJolt website.

 

This notice is provided in good faith that use of the material in the manner complained of is not authorized by the copyright owner, its agents, or the law.  Upon information and belief, the information set forth in this notice is accurate.  Under penalty of perjury, I certify that I am authorized to act on behalf of the copyright owner.

 

Nothing in this notice shall constitute a waiver or relinquishment of any right or remedy of Scottgames, LLC, Mr. Cawthon or any affiliated party, all of which are expressly reserved.

 
Thank you.
