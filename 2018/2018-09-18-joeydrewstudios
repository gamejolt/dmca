Our agent information is provided pursuant to Section 512(c) of the Digital Millennium Copyright Act (the “DMCA”).

Upon receipt of a complete and signed form, we will remove or disable access to the allegedly infringing content and will promptly notify the user who posted such content that access has been disabled, as is our obligation under the DMCA. If your notification is not signed or is not on this form and does not contain the authorization language of this form, we may work with you to obtain a properly executed notification. However, if any of the other information is missing from your notification, we will not be able to respond to your request.

Pursuant to Section 512(g)(2) of the DMCA, the user who posted the allegedly infringing content may provide us with a counter-notification, indicating that the allegedly infringing content was removed or disabled as the result of a mistake or misidentification of the content. This counter-notification must (a) be signed; (b) include the user's name, address and telephone number; (c) include a statement that the user is making the counter-notification under penalty of perjury and (d) state that the user consents to the jurisdiction of the federal district court where the user’s address is located. If we receive such a counter-notification, a copy will be sent to you notifying you that access to the allegedly infringing content will be restored within ten (10) business days. Access will be restored between the 10th and 14th business day after we receive a counter-notification, unless you inform us that you have filed an action seeking a court order to restrain the user who posted the allegedly infringing content from engaging in infringing activity on our network and servers.
