Pursuant to Section 512(g)(2) of the DMCA, the user who posted the allegedly infringing content may provide us with a counter-notification, indicating that the allegedly infringing content was removed or disabled as the result of a mistake or misidentification of the content. This counter-notification must (a) be signed; (b) include the user's name, address and telephone number; (c) include a statement that the user is making the counter-notification under penalty of perjury and (d) state that the user consents to the jurisdiction of the federal district court where the user’s address is located. If we receive such a counter-notification, a copy will be sent to you notifying you that access to the allegedly infringing content will be restored within ten (10) business days.
