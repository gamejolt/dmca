rightful legal owner of these properties and the titles, characters, themes, plots, stories and
settings thereof (the “Intellectual Property”).

Mr. Cawthon has registered over 80 copyrights with the United States Copyright Office

Additionally, Mr. Cawthon has authored a book titled “Five Nights at Freddy’s: The

The infringing works (“Infringing Works”) were uploaded to the GameJolt website and
made available to the public without the authorization of Mr. Cawthon or any of his agents.
The Infringing Works are unauthorized, pirated copies of Mr. Cawthon’s games/mobile
applications.

The users who have posted the Infringing Works have explicitly acknowledged that they
belong to Mr. Cawthon. In the description for each of the Infringing Works listed above, appears
one of the following:

- “This game is not really mine this game was made by Scott Cawthon. So far im
Publishing it if u have any Problems plz let me know.”

- “This is FNAF 2 now this one will take WAY more then the 1st game. This game was
Created by Scott Cawthon. I will try my best to upload this fast!”

- “This is FNAF Sister Location free, someone wanted me to make the Free one of this.
This game was made by Scott Cawthon”

- “Game made by Scoutt Cawthon”

This blatant disregard for Mr. Cawthon’s intellectual property rights amounts to
copyright and trademark infringement. The Infringing Works clearly intend to trade off the
goodwill and reputation of the Intellectual Property and the Protected Characters, in violation of
applicable trademark laws. Such improper violations of Mr. Cawthon’s intellectual property
rights constitute unfair competition, passing off, dilution and/or tarnishment.
This letter is official notification under the Digital Millennium Copyright Act that Mr.
Cawthon seeks the immediate removal of the aforementioned Infringing Works from the
GameJolt website.

This notice is provided in good faith that use of the material in the manner complained of
is not authorized by the copyright owner, its agents, or the law. The information in this notice is
accurate. Under penalty of perjury, I certify that I am authorized to act on behalf of the copyright
owner.

Nothing in this letter shall constitute a waiver or relinquishment of any right or remedy of
Scottgames, LLC, Mr. Cawthon or any affiliated party, all of which are expressly reserved.

Thank you.
